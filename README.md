pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn


Model Overview
The Credit Score ML Model uses a supervised learning approach to predict credit scores. It takes various financial inputs and outputs a predicted credit score along with a risk category (e.g., Low, Medium, High).

Input Features
The model accepts the following input features:

NIN: National Identification Number (string)
Income: Monthly income of the user (float)
Account Balance: Current account balance (float)
Spending Pattern:
Monthly Expenses (float)
Transaction Count (integer)
Credit History:
Previous Scores (list of floats)
Delinquent Accounts (integer)
Credit Inquiries (integer)
Model Architecture
The model is built using a combination of regression algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest) to predict credit scores based on input features. It has been trained on historical financial data to optimize accuracy.

Training and Evaluation
The model is trained on a dataset containing various financial profiles and their corresponding credit scores. The training process includes:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and normalizing the dataset.
Feature Selection: Identifying relevant features for training.
Model Training: Fitting the model on the training dataset.
Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared (RÂ²).
Usage
To use the model for predictions, input the required financial data into the API. The model will return a predicted credit score along with additional insights and recommendations for improving creditworthiness.

Example
Here's how to use the model in Python:

import requests

url = "https://api.limpiar.com/v1/credit-score/predict"
headers = {
    "Authorization": "Bearer your_api_key",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}
data = {
    "nin": "123456789",
    "income": 5000,
    "account_balance": 2500,
    "spending_pattern": {
        "monthly_expenses": 1500,
        "transaction_count": 20
    },
    "credit_history": {
        "previous_scores": [720, 740, 710],
        "delinquent_accounts": 1,
        "credit_inquiries": 2
    }
}
response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=data)
print(response.json())
